            </h>

            <h class="content0">
                As I’m nearing the end of bachelor’s in Design, I’ve realized that I grew more conscientious of the
                underlying problems in the ways that I used to view the world and my own experiences. The way I consume
                products, the way I think about waste and the way that I base my decisions on whether or not it is a
                good deal - all reveals just how privileged of a person I am and how I’ve been conditioned to think in a
                certain way. At the very least, I’m aware of it now, so I can act against it and rewire some of my
                unhealthy habits. One thing that was brought to my attention is my mom’s “addiction” to Shein. Every
                night when she comes back home, she would eat dinner and then sit for hours at the kitchen table; doom
                scrolling on her Ipad and looking through deals on Shein and AliExpress (I tell myself that it is her
                way of relaxing after a long day at work). I remember trying to convince her of Shein’s unethical labor
                practices and how she is contributing to it by buying so many cheap things from them - and she told me
                that it doesn’t matter because everything that we buy most likely comes from undisclosed corrupted
                supply chains in one way or another. Then, I argued that she already has so many clothes and does not
                need more because she can’t even wear everything and it’ll be a lot of waste, to which she angrily asks
                that I leave her be and that I should worry about my own problems.
                <br>
                <br>
                All this to say, the topic that I chose for this website project is the relationship between consumerism
                and the fast fashion industry, uncovering issues of transparency and corruption within the system. I
                won’t be pulling random statistics out of the Internet, but the gist of it all is essentially that big
                brand companies from developed countries supply most of their garments and other products from supplier
                companies in underdeveloped countries that sometimes do not have the means to provide safe and
                environmentally-friendly working conditions because they are poor. The supply chain lacks an overall
                control system to surveil those working conditions and help find ways to diminish environmental harm and
                unethical labor practices without taking jobs away from those who need it. There is a lot of corruption
                and bribery happening from the front to the back end of the supply chain and sadly, most of it is swept
                under the rug in order to protect the companies’ integrity and keep business rolling. There’s also the
                sad topic of child labor which is real and still in application in very poor countries. Families feel
                the need to put their children to work because they want to survive and these factory companies are
                willing to take them in as they have smaller hands and can work with needles or thin threads while also
                taking advantage of their young age to pay them way less than minimum wage. What’s more is that the
                working conditions are most likely hazardous and there is no form of proper equipment for the workers.
                Because they can’t escape their situation, these children are not able to acquire education and are
                stuck in the vicious cycle where they are provided the means and opportunities to escape poverty
                (Nizolli). With all of that in mind, a lot of brand companies feel inclined to hide those concerning
                issues in their supply chain to keep their public image, avoid accountability and ,of course, make more
                profit. This lack of transparency hinders any effort made to address these issues and make improvements
                (Raya). Some might not even be aware that this might be happening behind their radar (though, they
                probably know). If they are not complying to being transparent and tackling this recurring problem, it
                becomes our own responsibility as consumers to push for the implementation of laws regarding
                transparency, social or environmental responsibility and avoid supporting those big brand companies.

                A parody cryptic website that draws inspiration from the lack of transparency in the fast-fashion
                business model in terms
                of their production practices and the repercussions that it causes relating to sustainability and social
                responsibilities. The concept alludes to the absurdity of consumerism behavior and questions the “true
                cost” of clothes that are sold to the public.
                <br>
                <br>
                We will never truly know the environmental repercussions and social injustices that are entailed in the
                products that we “consume”. As a consumer, we are completely disconnected from the real products,
                everything is streamlined in a way that makes us only see what is being disguised like the tip of an
                iceberg. A simple T-shirt that is on sale might be the fruit of an unethical clothing supply chain that
                doesn’t disclose how they operate their production methods.
                <br>
                <br>
                The parody website invites us to rethink our consumerist mentality by allowing users to “buy” cryptic
                pieces of clothes that reveal the unethical human labor that is involved in making those products but
                also the absurdity of consumerism. It is
                disguised as a typical contemporary fashion retailer website, but the products being sold are completely
                obscure, inaccurate and defeats the notion of trends or anything remotely desirable from a consumer
                standpoint. The nature of the products are meant to expose the flaws of the fashion industry in a
                visually playful and unserious way. Each product is accompanied by little bits of information that
                reflects how it was made behind the radar. Depending on how much the user spends money on products, a
                different message will appear once they “pay” for their shopping cart; either spreading awareness or
                redirecting them to good sources relating to these issues (last part is still a work in progress).
                The project blends themes of consumerism, fast fashion, transparency, corruption and experimentation.

                <br>
                <br>
                Version 2 - A parody exclusive clothing line website with 10 limited edition products. Each product
                addresses or make reference to a different social/environmental issue within the fast fashion industry.
                For example, one could be about unethical labor practices, another could be greenwashing, etc. All of
                them would be marketed in a satirical way with cheesy taglines and over-the-top descriptions - this
                could provide links to sources relating to those issues to learn more about them. The user
                needs to buy all of the products and once they are done, another window will pop up and sort of go
                through the gist of the project and provide real solutions/sources as a consumer. 1. Quantity over
                quality/cheap
                2. Greenwashing 3. Poor working conditions 4. Unethical human labor/child labor 5. Lack of transparency
                6. Exclusivity/limited edition/luxury brands 7. Carbon Footprint/Pollution 8. Disposable design 9.
                Trends 10. ___
